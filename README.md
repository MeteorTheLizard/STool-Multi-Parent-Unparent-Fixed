# STool-Multi-Parent-Unparent-Remastered

Workshop Link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2761636936

This is a remastered version of the Multi-Parent and Multi-Unparent STools.


I completely remade the code so that the tools make use of modern functions.

The code is far more optimized compared to the old code and DOES NOT overwrite the Entity:GetChildren() function (WHICH CAN BREAK ADDONS!) which is what the old code did.

Additionally; I have fixed many crash exploits that involved the Multi-Parent and Multi-Unparent tool.

Fixed crash exploits:
- Parenting of world objects
- Parenting of vehicles (You can still parent TO vehicles but not vehicles themselves)

If you're a server owner and have the Multi-Parent and Multi-Unparent tools installed on your server, I highly suggest swapping to this Addon. The source is open to the public as well, meaning anyone can verify its legitimacy.
